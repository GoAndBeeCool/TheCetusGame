Team sought out to divy up the required task. As a team we decided:

Robert was assigned to be the "Master Debugger" along with the lead on the coding project. 
He assigned the coding task to the remainder of the team as well.

Gokul was in charge of reading the byte file that we were given and 
putting the data read from it into a format that kevin can use to create the icons the tiles will use.

Kevin after given the data from Gokul was to draw the icons that represented the maze pieces.
Each if the icons was associated with its respective id.

Austin was in charge of getting the reset button to work, where when the reset button was
clicked it would place all the tile pieces back to where they were at the start of the program.

Meeting completed at 1730

After a little under a week, the team came together to converse about assigned task and the progress 
so far prior to submitting final product. 

For the most part, everything was done outside of cleaning up some code for easier readability

Other than that, refer to the code to follow all changes made.

After all was said and done, the team only has error notification left along with saving locations. 

Meeting completed at 17:00

//Ninth Meeting 12APR2018 Basement COE //

Team met up 1600 on the ate posted above.

 Nic was in charge of the reset integration 
 Robert is set to be a floater, helping out when people get stuck.

 //12th and Final Meeting 6MAY2018 front of the enginering building//
 
 Team met up in front of the engineering building on the date posted.
 
 Originally, the team planned to meet up in RM4072 again, but the doors were locked.
 During some dicussion of the locked room, the teams head coder, Robert, told us that from
 a beautifully designed streaming procedure the team developed in the previous iterations, 
 the current iteration would be able to be completed in roughly 4 to 5 lines of code. Joyously, the team
 decided that this wasn't worth everyone sitting around a computer to witness the completion of the code and instead,
 Robert decided to take up the task himself. 
 
 The team then decided we would share some ideas on finishing the documentation, the task that Nic would be 
 the lead on. Some ideas included writing more for the minutes that passed, but we felt that was a little redundent and also 
 would involve us trying to remember things we talked about weeks prior, a task none of us were truly capable of doing honestly.
 In the end we decided upon adding a section to the Development plan that outlined our team work and also how each iteration went in much more detail than previously. 
 
 In the end, the team said their good-byes and set off to finish the project strong.
 
 Team finished final meeting at 1200, on the date posted above
